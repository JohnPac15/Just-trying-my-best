# Refector for Horisoen

## We took the broken outdated code and brought it up to date with modern code.

##


When Horiseon sent me the code, several things weren't quite right with the deployed website. When visitors would click on titles in the header nothing would happen. The general layout of the HTML was unorganized and hard to follow. Finally, The style sheet was out of order and full of redundancies.

After breaking the code down, The first task to complete was to organize the code structure. I installed header tags for the header element. Properly indented all necessary tags inside the header to make the HTML a more readable file. Next, I install proper code so when you click on "search engine optimization", "online reputation management", and "social media marketing" tabs would take you directly to their corresponding link. In the hero element, I needed to change the opening div tag with a section tab, and fix all the indentions for clean HTML reading. I also tweaked all img tags so there is a proper src code and alt description for SEO. Lastly, in the HTML file, I needed to add footer tags to open up this section. Then add proper copy-right tags, and fix all improper tag indention.  

Moving on to the style sheet. First off, I needed to clean up the file by setting everything in sequential order. While doing that reorganization, I was able to take notes of which classes and ids had redundant style tags. Using those notes I consolated every class and id I could to shink the style sheet. After all the consolation, I started with over 200 lines of style code and ended with 146 lines.
